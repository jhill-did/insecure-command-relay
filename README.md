# insecure-command-relay
Command listener for innocently trolling your friends.

Made in a day, mostly as a joke.

Allows you to start a listener on a victim's machine that will poll a webserver for a shell command. Fun for triggering text-to-speech on your friend's machine. Like a poor man's netcat only unidirectional and wont get picked up by anti-virus.
